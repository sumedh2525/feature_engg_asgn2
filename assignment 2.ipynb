    "The filter method is one of the approaches used in feature selection, a process in which relevant features (variables) are selected from a dataset to build a predictive model. The filter method operates independently of any specific machine learning algorithm and involves ranking features based on their intrinsic characteristics, such as their correlation with the target variable or statistical significance. The filter method aims to identify and retain the most informative features for modeling while discarding less relevant ones."

    "Embedded feature selection methods involve integrating feature selection into the process of training a machine learning model. These methods automatically select relevant features as part of the model training process. Embedded methods aim to find the most informative features for a specific model while avoiding overfitting and reducing dimensionality. Here are some common techniques used in embedded feature selection methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator):\n",
    "LASSO is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term to the least squares loss function. This penalty encourages the model to set some coefficients (and thus corresponding features) to exactly zero. As a result, LASSO automatically performs feature selection by favoring a sparse set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression:\n",
    "Similar to LASSO, ridge regression adds a penalty term to the least squares loss function, but the penalty is based on the squared values of the coefficients. While ridge regression doesn't set coefficients to zero like LASSO, it can still lead to feature selection by shrinking less relevant coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net:\n",
    "Elastic Net combines the L1 (LASSO) and L2 (ridge regression) penalties, striking a balance between feature selection and regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees and Random Forests:\n",
    "Decision trees and ensemble methods like Random Forests have built-in feature selection mechanisms. Features that contribute most to the model's decision-making process are given higher importance scores. Tree-based models can be used to rank or select features based on these scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Boosting:\n",
    "Gradient Boosting algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM) use a similar approach to decision trees, assigning feature importance scores during the boosting process. These scores can be used for feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized Linear Models (e.g., Logistic Regression with L1 penalty):\n",
    "Similar to LASSO for linear regression, regularized linear models like logistic regression with L1 penalty can automatically perform feature selection by shrinking coefficients toward zero."
